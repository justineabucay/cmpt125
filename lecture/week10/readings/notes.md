# C++ OOP

- **OOP** = Object-Oriented Programming -> creating objs, which can hold data and functions that work on that data

## what are classes and objects? 
- <mark>class</mark> defines what an object should look like
- <mark>object</mark> is created based on that class
&nbsp;for example: FRUITS -> APPLE, BANANA + MANGO

## procedural vs. OOP
- **procedural**: writing functions that operate on data
- **OOP**: creating objects that contain <mark>both data and functions</mark>
