test case #1
arr1 = {1, 1}, arr2 = {1, 2} have different values and therefore, not identical.

test case #2
arr1 = {24, 0, 1}, arr2 = {0, 24, 1} have the same values and therefore, are identical.

test case #3
arr1 = {1, 2, 3}, arr2 = {1, 2} have different sizes and therefore, not identical.

test case #4
arr1 = {}, arr2 = {} have the same values and therefore, are identical.
