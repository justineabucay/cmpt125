## exercise 1.2:  understanding stack vs. heap allocation

from what i understand, the variable ```c heap_var``` and ```c heap_array``` are pointers that point to memory on the heap, where all their elements are stored.  

the closest addresses would be on the stack because they are allocated on the same stack frame and therefore, will have consecutive memory addresses. on the other hand, heap uses dynamic allocation which can place memory any where on the heap.
