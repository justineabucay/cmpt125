# general notes from week 1
- all variables must be declared before they can be executed
    - a declaration consists of a type name and the variable

            int lower, upper, step; 

- the range of data types (i.e., int or float) vary depending on the computer you are using
- assignment statment sets the variables to their initial values.
- proper indentation is important -- it could determine the logical structure of your program. also, it makes your code easy to read. 
- the function printf expects a declaration of a type name like '%d' for integers 

**width specification in printf**
